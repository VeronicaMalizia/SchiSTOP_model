# Schisto_model
Transmission model of Schistosomiasis

## First model for Schistosomiasis transmission
The main branch is up to date with the SEI_model_snails.

File 01 contains the main script to run the model and within the code it calls file 01.a providing the model specification.

Files 00* are the demography only, without transmission dynamics. Initial explorations. None of these methods is currently used.

File 02 explores snail population dynamics through the ODEs-based SEI model.
