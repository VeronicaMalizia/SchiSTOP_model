# Schisto_model
Transmission model of Schistosoma mansoni infection dynamics. Agent-based model for infection dynamics within the human host and ODE-based module for the infection dynamics within the snail host.

File 05_Run_model.R contains the script to run the model and save results. This is the main file to run the model, it calls the previous scripts at different moments of the implementation.
"Setting_simulation_scenario.R": here the user can set scenario-specific parameters (saved in Zetas*.xlsx files) and functions. This will prepare the setting to run simulations.
